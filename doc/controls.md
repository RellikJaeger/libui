## Reference

### `uiControl`

```c
typedef struct uiControl uiControl;
uint32_t uiControlType(void);
#define uiControl(obj) ((uiControl *) uiCheckControlType((obj), uiControlType()))
```

`uiControl` is an opaque type that describes a control.

`uiControlType()` is the type identifier of a `uiControl` as passed to `uiCheckControlType()`. You rarely need to call this directly; the `uiControl()` conversion macro does this for you. A control type identifier of 0 is always invalid; this can be used to initialize the variables that hold the returned identifiers from `uiRegisterControlType()`.

### `uiControlVtable`

```c
typedef struct uiControlVtable uiControlVtable;
struct uiControlVtable {
	size_t Size;
	bool (*Init)(uiControl *c, void *implData, void *initData);
	void (*Free)(uiControl *c, void *implData);
	void (*ParentChanging)(uiControl *c, void *implData, uiControl *oldParent);
	void (*ParentChanged)(uiControl *c, void *implData, uiControl *newParent);
};
```

`uiControlVtable` describes the set of functions that control implementations need to implement. When registering your control type, you pass this in as a parameter to `uiRegisterControlType()`. Each method here is required.

You are responsible for allocating and initializing this struct. To do so, you simply zero the memory for this struct and set its `Size` field to `sizeof (uiControlVtable)`. (TODO put this in a common place)

Each method takes at least two parameters. The first, `c`, is the `uiControl` itself. The second, `implData`, is the implementation data pointer; it is the same as the pointer returned by `uiControlImplData(c)`, and is provided here as a convenience.

Each method is named for the `uiControl` function that it implements. As such, details on how to implement these methods are documented alongside those functions. For instance, instructions on implementing `Free()` are given under the documentation for `uiControlFree()`. The only exception is `Init()`, which is discussed under `uiNewControl()` below.

### `uiRegisterControlType()`

```c
uint32_t uiRegisterControlType(const char *name, const uiControlVtable *vtable, const uiControlOSVtable *osVtable, size_t implDataSize);
```

`uiRegisterControlType()` registers a new `uiControl` type with the given vtables and returns its ID as passed to `uiNewControl()`. `implDataSize` is the size of the implementation data struct that is created by `uiNewControl()`.

Each type has a name, passed in the `name` parameter. The type name is only used for debugging and error reporting purposes. The type name should be a standard C string using the system encoding (TODO proper terminology), rather than a UTF-8 string as with the rest of libui. The type name is copied into libui-internal memory; the `name` pointer passed to `uiRegisterControlType()` is not used after it returns. It is a programmer error to specify `NULL` for `name`. (TODO anything else? Empty string? Duplicate name?) (TODO reserved name rules)

`uiControlVtable` describes the functions of a `uiControl` common between platforms, and is discussed above. `uiControlOSVtable` describes functionst hat vary from OS to OS, and are described in the respective OS-specific uiControl implementation pages. The two vtables are copied into libui-internal memory; the vtable pointers passed to `uiRegisterControlType()` are not used after it returns.

It is a programmer error to specify `NULL` for either vtable. It is also a programmer error to specify `NULL` for any of the methods in either vtable â€” that is, all methods are required. It is also a programmer error to pass the wrong value to the `Size` field of either vtable.

An `implDataSize` of 0 is legal; the implementation data pointer will be `NULL`. This is not particularly useful, however.

### `uiCheckControlType()`

```c
void *uiCheckControlType(void *c, uint32_t type);
```

`uiCheckControlType()` checks whether `c` is a `uiControl`, and if so, whether it is of the type specified by `type`. If `c` is `NULL`, or if either of the above conditions is false, a programmer error is raised. If the conditions are met, the function returns `c` unchanged.

This function is intended to be used to implement a macro that converts an arbitrary `uiControl` pointer into a specific type. For instance, `uiButton` exposes its type ID as a function `uiButtonType()`, and provides the macro `uiButton()` that does the actual conversion as so:

```c
#define uiButton(c) ((uiButton *) uiCheckControlType((c), uiButtonType()))
```

(TODO document passing uiControlType() to this, or even make doing so unnecessary)

### `uiNewControl()`

```c
uiControl *uiNewControl(uint32_t type, void *initData);
```

`uiNewControl()` creates a new `uiControl` of the given type.

This function is meant for control implementations to use in the implementation of dedicated creation functions; for instance, `uiNewButton()` calls `uiNewControl()`, passing in the appropriate values for `initData`. `initData` is, in turn, passed to the control's `Init()` method, and its format is generally internal to the control. Normal users should not call this function.

It is a programmer error to pass an invalid value for either `type` or `initData`.

**For control implementations**: This function allocates both the `uiControl` and the memory for the implementation data, and then passes both of these allocations as well as the value of `initData` into your `Init()` method. Before calling `Init()`, libui will clear the `implData` memory, as with `memset(0)`. Return `false` from the `Init()` method if `initData` is invalid; if it is valid, initialize the control and return `true`. To discourage direct use of `uiNewControl()`, you should generally not allow `initData` to be `NULL`, even if there are no parameters. Do **not** return `false` for any other reason, including other forms of initialization failures; see [Error handling](error-handling.md) for details on what to do instead.
TODO is this whole spiel about the return value even necessary? shouldn't the outer library be responsible for handling errors instead?

### `uiControlFree()`

```c
void uiControlFree(uiControl *c);
```

`uiControlFree()` frees the given control.

If `c` has children, those children are also freed. It is a programmer error to free a control that is itself a child of another control.

It is a programmer error to specify `NULL` for `c`.

**For control implementations**: This function calls your vtable's `Free()` method. Parameter validity checks are already performed. Your `Free()` should call `uiControlFree()` on all your control's children and free dynamically allocated memory that is part of your implementation data. Once your `Free()` method returns, libui will take care of freeing the implementation data memory block itself.

## `uiControlSetParent()`

```c
uiprivExtern void uiControlSetParent(uiControl *c, uiControl *parent);
```

`uiControlSetParent()` marks `parent` as the parent of `c`. `parent` may be `NULL`, in which case the control has no parent.

This function is used by the implementation of a container control to actually establish a parent-child relationship from libui's point of view. This function is only intended to be called by control implementations. You should not call it directly; instead, use the methods provided by your container control to add children.

This function can only be used to set the parent of an unparented control or to remove its parent. It may not be used to change the parent of an already parented control. It is a programmer error to set the parent of a control that already has a parent to something other than `NULL` (even if to the same parent), or to set the parent of a control with no parent to `NULL`. (The idea here is to reinforce the concept of container implementations being responsible for setting their children properly, not the user.)

It is a programmer error to pass `NULL` for `c`. (TODO non-uiControl for either c or parent?)

It is a programmer error to introduce a cycle when changing the parent of a control. By extension, it is a programmer error to make a control its own parent.

TODO top-levels and parenting

**For control implementations**: You would call this when adding a control to your container, preferably before actually doing any internal bookkeeping. Likewise, call this when removing a child, preferably after doing any internal bookkeeping.

The child will receive a call to its `ParentChanging()` method before the actual change happens, and a call to `ParentChanged()` afterward, receiving the old and new parent, respectively, as an argument. This is where OS-specific parenting code would go; specific instructions can be found in each OS's uiControl implementation page.

TODO do things this way to avoid needing to check if reparenting from a container implementation, or do that manually each time? we used to have uiControlVerifySetParent()...
TODO I forgot what this meant

Container implementations are free to un-parent and then immediately re-parent a child should some platform-specific need to recreate any existing OS-level relations arise. For example, on Windows, this would be how to signal that a new parent handle is available, and the child would respond by destroying its current window handles and creating new ones. Refer to each individual platform documentation for details. In particular, this means that implemenations of `ParentChanging()` and `ParentChanged()` should not make any assumptions as to why the parent is changing.

## `uiControlImplData()`

```c
void *uiControlImplData(uiControl *c);
```

`uiControlImplData()` returns the pointer to the implementation data for `c`. The returned pointer is valid for the lifetime of `c`.

This function is meant to be used by control implementations only. There is in general no guarantee as to the size or format of this pointer. Normal users should not call `uiControlImplData()`.

It is a programmer error to pass `NULL` for `c`. (TODO non-uiControl?)
